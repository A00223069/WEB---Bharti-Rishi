          <h1><u>Landscape & Nature Photography Tips</u></h1>

              Though photography and painting on canvas are both two-dimensional art forms that function according to the same fundamental principles of composition and design, I would argue that most photographers operate rather like subtractive sculptors—like Michelangelo.
